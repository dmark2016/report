\label{sec:conclusion}
%This section concludes your work by briefly repeating the
%goal of your work and stating the main results. It can also
%include planned future work.

Of the different prefetching strategies explored in this report,
global history buffer with delta correlation had the best average
speedup while no benchmark had a speedup of less than 0.95. Thus
this prefetcher best matches with the goal of achieving a speedup
over a wide variety of benchmarks with none of them getting a
speedup of less than 0.95.

However, while this prefetcher had the highest average
speedup, simpler prefetchers were sometimes better on
individual benchmarks, showing that while global history buffer
with delta correlation is on average the best for the benchmarks
used for testing in this case, it is not the best in all cases.

To improve the prefetcher further, a scheme to choose which
entry should be evicted when the global history buffer is full,
based on the probability that the entry will be useful in the
future could be introduced.
