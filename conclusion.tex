\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%This section concludes your work by briefly repeating the
%goal of your work and stating the main results. It can also
%include planned future work.

Of the different prefetching strategies explored in this report,
global history buffer with delta correlation has the best average
speedup while no benchmark has a speedup of less than 0.95.

This prefetcher has a higher average speedup than our hybrid
approach. This falsifies our hypothesis that we would achieve
a higher average speedup by falling back on RTP and SDP when
DC does not find anything to prefetch.

However, while this prefetcher has the highest average
speedup, simpler prefetchers are sometimes better on
individual benchmarks, showing that while global history buffer
with delta correlation is on average the best for the benchmarks
used for testing in this case, it is not the best in all cases.

To improve the prefetcher further, a scheme to choose which
entry should be evicted when the global history buffer is full,
based on the probability that the entry will be useful in the
future, could be introduced.

% Improvement: Tag for index table (like in caches) to prevent mixing histories
% from different PCs
