\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
% \subsection{Description}
% The methodology section explains your experimental setup.
% It should state every bit of information that is necessary in
% order to be able to reproduce your results. It further covers
% your actions taken in order to ensure that you are really
% measuring what you think you are measuring as well as your
% actions that were taken in order to validate your results. The
% goals are to set up realistic experiments and be absolutely
% convinced that you took care of all side-effects as well as to
% state enough information such that your experiments are fully
% reproducible.

\subsection{Simulated Architecture}

We use the M5 computer architecture simulator~\cite{bib:m5} to evaluate different prefetching techniques.
The simulated architecture is that of the Alpha 21264\cite{bib:alpha-21264}, a superscalar, out-of-order CPU.
The simulator is configured with a two level cache system; level 1 is a split cache with 32 kB for instructions and 64 kB for data, level 2 a combined cache of 1 MB.
Access to main memory takes $30$ns over a $64$ bit memory bus clocked at $400$ MHz.

We implement a prefetcher as a set of C++ functions specified by the memory interface of the simulator~\cite[Section 3.2]{bib:doc}.
\texttt{prefetch\_init()}, which is called when the simulation starts, allows us to initialize data structures.
\texttt{prefetch\_access()} is called every time the L2 cache is accessed.
Here, we decide if and what we should prefetch.

The prefetcher is compiled into the simulator before running benchmarks to evaluate its performance.

\subsection{Benchmarking}

The SPEC CPU2000\cite{bib:cpu2000} is a suite of benchmark programs designed to test hardware performance.
To evaluate prefetcher performance, we use a subset of the programs available in the suite.
They are as follows; \texttt{bzip2}, a compression algorithm, \texttt{twolf},
a place-and-route package used in microchip design, \texttt{wupwise}, a solver for a set of
equations in the field of quantum chromodynamics, \texttt{swim} a weather prediction program,
\texttt{applu} and \texttt{ammp}, differential equation solvers, \texttt{galgel}, a solver for a
particular problem in fluid dynamics and \texttt{apsi}, a program used to predict spread of air pollution.
These programs have different memory access patterns, helping us expose flaws in prefetching schemes.
For each program, a number of metrics are reported by the simulator.

\subsection{Performance measures}
Several different characteristics are used to measure the performance
of the prefetchers. The most important one is the speedup of a
prefetcher compared to running without a prefetcher:

$speedup = \frac{execution time_{without prefetcher}}{execution time_{with prefetcher}}$.

In additon, accuracy and coverage are useful measures. Accuracy measures
how many of the prefetches were actually needed:

$accuracy = \frac{good prefetches}{total prefetches}$.

Even if the prefetches were needed it is not guaranteed that they
were used. They may have been issued too late.

Coverage measures how many of the misses were removed by the
prefetcher:

$coverage = \frac{good prefetches}{cache misses without prefetching}$.
