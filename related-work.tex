Reducing the memory access time is an important issue in computer design.
Memory prefetching is a technique to reduce memory access times,
and an significant amount of research have gone into memory prefetchers.

\textit{Evaluation of Hardware-Based Stride and Sequential Prefetching in Shared-Memory Multiprocessors} \ref{bib:stride}
is a paper on stride and sequential prefetching.
In this paper their finding was that sequential prefetching in some cases performed better than stride prefetching.
They argued that a significant amount of the strides were shorter than the block size.


%There is a significant difference between CPU and memory speed.
%In recent years, it has become increasingly important to speed up memory access to ensure that the CPU is not spending much of its time idle, waiting for data.
%Prefetching is one technique used to reduce memory access time.

%Several prefetcher techniques have been researched, in order to increase memory performance.
%Well known algorithms are: sequential, stride directed \ref{bib:stride}, reference prediction table \ref{bib:jahre} and delta correlation \ref{bib:ghb}.

%A sequential prefetcher uses the principle of spatial locality.
%If one memory block is accessed, the next memory block is most likely to be used.
%However not all memory acceses are sequential,
%and an improvment to sequental prefetcher is a stride direct prefetcher.
%If a program traverses a multiple dimensional array,
%each dimension may be placed in different places in memory,
%but with a constant stride.
%By storing the memory difference the next memory stride can be prefeched.
%A futher improvement is reference table prefetcher,
%which also contains a state.
%Each time a stride is used the state is recalculated to recieve better predicions.
%Lastly the global history buffer prefetcher utilizes a FIFO queue and an index table.
%The index table contains the PC value and a pointer to the FIFO queue,
%and the FIFO queue contains the global miss address.

%To achieve best results GHB is used together with delta correlation or stride prefeching.
%This hybrid algorithm is described in greather depth in \textit{Data Cacheprefetching Using a Global History Buffer} \ref{bib:ghb}.
