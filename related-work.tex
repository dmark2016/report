There is a significant difference between CPU and memory speed.
And in the recent years the technology has hit a memory wall.
Prefetching is one technique to increase performance, despite the memory wall.
A prefetcher fetches instructions into cache before they are needed,
in order to avoid the latency introduced by main memory.

Several prefetcher techniques have been researched, in order to increase memory performance.
Well known algorithms are: sequential, stride direct \ref{bib:stride}, reference table \ref{bib:jahre} and global history buffer \ref{bib:ghb}.

A sequential prefetcher uses the principle of spatial locality.
If one memory block is accessed, the next memory block is most likely to be used.
However not all memory acceses are sequential,
and an improvment to sequental prefetcher is a stride direct prefetcher.
If a program traverses a multiple dimensional array,
each dimension may be placed in different places in memory,
but with a constant stride.
By storing the memory difference the next memory stride can be prefeched.
A futher improvement is reference table prefetcher,
which also contains a state.
Each time a stride is used the state is recalculated to recieve better predicions.
Lastly the global history buffer prefetcher utilizes a FIFO queue and an index table.
The index table contains the PC value and a pointer to the FIFO queue,
and the FIFO queue contains the global miss address.

To achieve best results GHB is used together with delta correlation or stride prefeching.
This hybrid algorithm is described in greather depth in \textit{Data Cacheprefetching Using a Global History Buffer} \ref{bib:ghb}.
