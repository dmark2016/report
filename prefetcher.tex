\section{Prefetcher (maybe change this title)}
\label{sec:prefetcher}
\subsection{Description}
This section explains your proposed solution in full detail.
It needs to strike a fine balance between unnecessary implementation
details and a level of abstraction that is too high.
The goal is to give enough detail such that the audience of
your paper is able to reimplement your scheme, but not more.
Informative figures and examples are a very powerful tool for
conveying necessary information to your audience, and are
often worth more than a thousand words.
