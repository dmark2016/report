\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results-and-discussion}
% \subsection{Description}
% This section presents the results of your experiments,
% comparing your solution to other schemes. The metrics of
% interest are highly dependent on the topic of research, but
% should optimally cover all interesting aspects of your scheme.
% Informative graphs or tables are the key to a good result
% section.
% Furthermore, you need to discuss your results. You should
% give explanations of distinctive points and outliers in your
% results. It is also necessary to state why your scheme is
% better/worse compared to the other schemes. Thus, this section
% consists of two parts: the results of your experiments, as well
% as an explanation as to why the results are as they are

\subsubsection{Sequential Prefetcher}
During the early stages of development a naive, sequential implementation of a prefetcher was tested.
The resulting average speedup for different prefetching degrees $p$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:seqavg}.
No degree of sequential prefetching achieves an average speedup $> 1.0$.
Figure \ref{fig:seq3} shows the individual benchmark results for a sequential prefetcher with $p = 3$.
The same behaviour of increased and decreased speedup values averaging to $\sim 1.0$ was observed for all sequential prefetchers with $\{p \in \mathbf{Z} | 1 \leq p \leq 7\}$
Sequential prefetching effects the \texttt{applu} and \texttt{wupwise} benchmarks positively, while having significant negative impact on the \texttt{ammp} benchmark.

\subsubsection{Stride Direct Prefetcher}
A simple implementation of a stride direct prefetcher yielded a better average speedup ($1.07$) than the sequential prefetcher.
The benchmarks wupwise and ammp had high speedups, which pulled up the average.
This prefetcher had a negative impact on the twolf benchmark.

\subsubsection{Reference Prediction Table}
The RPT implementation yielded an average speedup of $1.06$.
While slightly lower than the SDP average, the maximum and minimum values are closer together.
Testing of the RPT implementation saw no benchmark with a speedup of less than $0.95$.
Figure~\ref{fig:rpt} shows how RPT performs on each benchmark.

\subsubsection{Global History Buffer with Delta Correlation}
The implementation of the global history buffer with SDP and RTP as fallback was successfully implemented and yielded the speedups shown in Figure \ref{fig:ghbdc}.
The best speedup was acquired for the ammp benchmark, but many of the other benchmark showed only a slight speedup if any at all.

%\subsection{Description}
% This section might elaborate on alternative approaches that
% you have tried, but were not successful. It discusses weaknesses
% of your scheme and highlights the strong and weak
% points of your experimental setup.

Experimenting with sequential prefetching of various degrees yielded surprisingly good results for some benchmarks.
A possible explanation for this is that the benchmark's behavior matched exceptionally well with the assumptions used when creating the prefetcher.
Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the \texttt{applu} and \texttt{wupwise} benchmarks access memory fairly sequentially.

\todo{RPT}

Our hybrid implementation 
More interesting to note, is that the delta-correlation implementation does an exceptionally good job at the \texttt{ammp} benchmark.
This was the benchmark with the highest negative performance impact from the naive sequential prefetcher, but the memory pattern seems to be very well suited for delta correlation.
