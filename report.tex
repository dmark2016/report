\begin{abstract}
  As processor performance increases at a higher rate than memory performance, new techniques are developed to minimize the decreased performance resulting from the CPU spending time idle while waiting for data. Cache hierarchies put frequently used data closer to the processor. To ensure that the right data is in cache at the right time, data is fetched from a lower level in the hierarchy before the processor requests it. Predicting what to fetch when, known as prefetching, is a hard problem and can be approached in many ways. In this paper we evaluate several prefetching techniques. We hypothesize that a hybrid of several techniques will lead to increased performance. The prefetchers we implement are simulated in software. We find that the fastest non-hybrid prefetcher achieves an average speedup in program execution time of $1.09$. Our hybrid approach achieves only $1.09$.
