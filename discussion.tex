Our initial experimentation with sequential prefetching of various degrees yielded surprisingly good results for some benchmarks.
A possible explanation for this is that the benchmark's behavior matched exceptionally well with the assumptions used when creating the prefetcher.
Thus  applu benchmark probably accesses memory in a sequential manner.

More interesting to note, is that the GHB implementation does an exceptionally good job at the \texttt{ammp} benchmark.
This was the benchmark with the highest negative performance impact from the naive sequential prefetcher, but the memory pattern seems to be very well suited for delta correlation.
