Experimenting with sequential prefetching of various degrees yielded surprisingly good results for some benchmarks.
A possible explanation for this is that the benchmark's behavior matched exceptionally well with the assumptions used when creating the prefetcher.
Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the \texttt{applu} and \texttt{wupwise} benchmarks access memory fairly sequentially.

Our hybrid implementation 
More interesting to note, is that the delta-correlation implementation does an exceptionally good job at the \texttt{ammp} benchmark.
This was the benchmark with the highest negative performance impact from the naive sequential prefetcher, but the memory pattern seems to be very well suited for delta correlation.
