\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In modern computer architecture, the memory hierarchy plays an important part.
Without intelligent usage of caches and scheduling of requests to main memory, the processor will spend an undesirable amount of time idle while waiting for data.
Prefetching aims to reduce cache misses and increase data availability by attempting to predict which data will be needed in the future and fetch it early. \todo{rephrase}
Designing a prefetcher that performs well for all programs is hard.
Depending on the type of program, different memory access patterns arise, making it necessary for the prefetcher to be adaptive.

In this paper, we present a prefetcher design that measurably increases performance for a wide range of program types.

This paper provides background (section~\ref{sec:background}) on various prefetcher strategies as well as an overview of our process and methodology (section~\ref{sec:methodology}).
Subsequently, the finished prefetcher design is presented (section~\ref{sec:prefetcher}), followed by results and perfomance details (section~\ref{sec:results}).
Finally, we discuss (section~\ref{sec:discussion}) our findings, provide an overview of some related works (section~\ref{sec:related-work}) and a conclusion (section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).
