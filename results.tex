\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% \subsection{Description}
% This section presents the results of your experiments,
% comparing your solution to other schemes. The metrics of
% interest are highly dependent on the topic of research, but
% should optimally cover all interesting aspects of your scheme.
% Informative graphs or tables are the key to a good result
% section.
% Furthermore, you need to discuss your results. You should
% give explanations of distinctive points and outliers in your
% results. It is also necessary to state why your scheme is
% better/worse compared to the other schemes. Thus, this section
% consists of two parts: the results of your experiments, as well
% as an explanation as to why the results are as they are

\subsubsection{Sequential Prefetcher}
During the early stages of development a naive, sequential implementation of a prefetcher was tested.
The resulting average speedup for different prefetching degrees $p$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:seqavg}.
No degree of sequential prefetching achieves an average speedup $> 1.0$.
Figure \ref{fig:seq3} shows the individual benchmark results for a sequential prefetcher with $p = 3$.
The same behaviour of increased and decreased speedup values averaging to $\sim 1.0$ was observed for all sequential prefetchers with $\{p \in \mathbf{Z} | 1 \leq p \leq 7\}$
Sequential prefetching effects the \texttt{applu} and \texttt{wupwise} benchmarks positively, while having significant negative impact on the \texttt{ammp} benchmark.

\subsubsection{Stride Direct Prefetcher}
A simple implementation of a stride direct prefetcher yielded a better average speedup than the sequential prefetcher.
The benchmarks wupwise and ammp had high speedups, which pulled up the average.
This prefetcher had a negative impact on the twolf benchmark.

\subsubsection{Global History Buffer with Delta Correlation}
The implementation of the global history buffer with SDP and RTP as fallback was successfully implemented and yielded the speedups shown in Figure \ref{fig:ghbdc}.
The best speedup was acquired for the ammp benchmark, but many of the other benchmark showed only a slight speedup if any at all.
